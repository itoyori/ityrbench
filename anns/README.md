# pbbsbench

The Problem Based Benchmark Suite (PBBS) is a collection
of over 20 benchmarks defined in terms of their IO characteristics.
They are designed to make it possible to compare different algorithms,
or implementations in different programming languages.

Information on the organization and on how to run PBBS can be found on
[this page](https://cmuparlay.github.io/pbbsbench).
